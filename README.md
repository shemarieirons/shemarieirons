## ✨ About Me
I'm dedicated to exploring how computational tools can improve outcomes. From building a medical records database in Python and SQL to creating web apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I love applying technology to solve real-world problems. 

Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. I’m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

<br>
As a young Black woman in STEM, I'm committed to creating inclusive spaces and empowering underrepresented voices in tech.
